Sadly, some of these are off the beaten-track and without prior knowledge; hard to find. With that in mind I created Independent Bath to showcase independent businesses in the wonderful city I have called home for the past 6 years.</p><div class="container-image-buster"><img src="assets/images/screenshot.jpg" title="A screenshot of Independent Bath"></div><h2>Conception</h2><p>I've always loved Bath and I wanted to help show off some of our incredible independent retailers. I thought the best way to do this would be to do what I do best, create a website! Over a few weeks and countless late nights, I had an initial version I was happy with. I then spent an extra few weeks populating with content from sources around the web and emailing retailers directly.</p><div class="container-image-buster"><img src="assets/images/screenshot2.jpg" title="A screenshot of Independent Bath"></div><h2>Technicals</h2><p>Independent Bath runs on WordPress and uses a custom boilerplate template that I've built over the past few years. With complex use of custom fields, I have been able to output a lot of useful retailer information to help people decide who they want to visit. Whilst building the site I also got to play around with a <a href="http://independentbath.co/map/" target="_blank" title="A link to Independent Bath's map">custom map</a>, which uses MapBox's API.</p><h2>Impact</h2><p>Independent Bath has had a lasting legacy on the bath independent scene. Being one of the first sites of its kind, it has inspired countless others to promote our local economy. I continue to work with local businesses on their websites and online presence as a result of building contacts through the project.</p></section><footer class="container container-project-link" id="project-link"><a href="http://independentbath.co" title="Visit Independent Bath" target="_blank">Visit Independent Bath</a> <a href="../../projects/bluprint" title="Visit Next Project" class="remove-line next-link">Visit Next <span>Project</span></a></footer></div><script>var rellax=new Rellax(".rellax")</script></body></html>
