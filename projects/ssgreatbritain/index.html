The project was my first project written in Vue.js; a tool that became invaluable when working with the interactive elements of the site and the huge dataset we were provided with.</p><div class="container-image-buster"><img src="assets/images/screenshot.jpg" title="A screenshot the voyage card"></div><h2>Technicals</h2><p>The app was built using Vue.js, with all data coming from a custom API that our back-end team built. The CMS is Spirit, our in-house platform. The front-end is fully responsive and uses Google Maps for the maps functionality.</p><div class="container-image-buster"><img src="assets/images/screenshot2.jpg" title="A screenshot of the map feature"></div><h2>Impact</h2><p>The app has had a big impact on-board the ship, launching to much praise from voluenteers and staff, as well as visitors to the museum over the busy half-term week. I hope to take what we have and improve on it with new features and functionality in due course.</p><p><a href="http://globalstories.ssgreatbritain.org" title="Visit Global Stories" target="_blank">Visit Global Stories</a></p></section><footer class="container container-project-link" id="project-link"><a href="../../projects/bluprint" title="Visit Previous Project" class="remove-line previous-link">Visit Previous <span>Project</span></a> <a href="../../projects/tomorrowsweb" title="Visit Next Project" class="remove-line next-link">Visit Next <span>Project</span></a></footer></div><script>var rellax=new Rellax(".rellax")</script></body></html>
